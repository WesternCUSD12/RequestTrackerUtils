# Specification Quality Checklist: LDAP/Active Directory Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-03  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Three user stories defined with clear priority ordering (P1: tech-team full access, P2: teacher limited access, P3: unauthorized rejection)
- AD group names explicitly specified: "tech-team" and "TEACHERS"
- Role hierarchy clear: tech-team > TEACHERS (dual membership gets higher privilege)
- Session behavior and edge cases documented
